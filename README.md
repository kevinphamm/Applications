Why is Version/Source control important?
Version control is important because it allows for you to be able to have a code modification history. Version control allows you to be able to view the entire history of every single commit made to the prject by all the developers involved. It just allows for east tracking of changes made. Also, if something were to go wrong with an updated project file, you can do a rollback to a previous version that was committed that actually still works. Some other features as to why Version control is important is concurrent file editing and branching. Branching is very powerful because it allows for you to create a seperate copy of your project to perform certain actions. For example, if you were able to create a branch of your project and then fix any bugs or problems in that branch, you can then merge the branch with the trunk. Branches are useful in developing experimental features that can be later merged down the road. Version control allows for a team of developers to work productively. It allows for multiple developers to work together on a project with ease and being able to understand who made changes and when the changes were made. Developers can make changes to the project with confidence and without a worry because reverting to previous version can be done. Also, the fact that all the files and directory structures are the same allows for consistency among all the team members.

well done!
